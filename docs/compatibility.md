# Compatibility policy

The provider hooks an internal, non-public FRITZ!OS process ABI. Compatibility
is therefore an explicit allowlist, never a broad version claim.

## Validated baseline

| Component | Validated version |
|---|---|
| Bridge hardware | FRITZ!Box 7530 classic / HW236 |
| Bridge firmware | FRITZ!OS 8.25, revision 131719 |
| `aha` SHA-256 | `4e85494198125132876aafa0cb88cf2d873266904b7098b6e4213c3ce8a38aaf` |
| Freetz-NG | commit `995afdf2ded44fbb342e69e5941d9ad36a274e93` |
| Mesh master used in tests | FRITZ!Box 6690 Cable, FRITZ!OS 8.25 |
| Controller used in tests | FRITZ!Smart Control 440, firmware 05.45 |

The provider refuses startup if bridge model, architecture or `aha` fingerprint
is unknown. Adding another firmware requires offline protocol
comparison, isolated self-tests and a live laboratory qualification run.

The listed Mesh combination is functionally validated, including exact
brightness round trips. It is not the recommended latency topology: commands
from the 6690 master to virtual endpoints on the 7530 took about 6–7 seconds in
the laboratory. Direct pairing of the 440 with the dedicated bridge box is the
tested target topology. Version 0.1.5 completed switch and brightness command
round trips in both directions and is now undergoing longer everyday testing.
